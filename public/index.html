        <h3>What is the IEEE?</h3>
        <p>
        A non-profit organization, the IEEE is the world's leading professional association for the advancement of technology.

        The IEEE name was originally an acronym for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. Today, the organization's scope of interest has expanded into so many related fields, that it is simply referred to by the letters I-E-E-E. IEEE is a source of technical and professional information for students and professionals. It is a leading authority in all practices of electro-technologies, computer science, optics and other related fields. Currently, IEEE has over 370,000 members, 80,000 of whom are students.
