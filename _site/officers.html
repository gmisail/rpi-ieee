                Hello everyone, I am Ivan Hammel, your RPI-IEEE President. A junior Computer and Systems Engineer, I
                won’t let Spring 2021 being a Co-op experience stop me from pushing this organization to its fullest
                potential. An avid tea drinker, I also enjoy exploring the mountains near my home and getting late night
                at the RPI Union. Please feel free to contact me at hammei@rpi.edu for any reason, be it help with a
                course such as Data Structures, for a third-party resume critique, or about any IEEE related questions.
