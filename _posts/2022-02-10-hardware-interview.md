Chipdev.io and IEEE would like to welcome you to a hardware interview prep event!

Founders Joao Cerqueira, Olivier Jin, Ronnel Boettcher, and Daniel Hsu have created chipdev.io as a website where engineers can practice hardware interview questions around Verilog and RTL. With prolific professional hardware engineering experience at Apple, Nvidia, Intel, and Tesla, as well as a PhD in Electrical Engineering they're very familiar with hardware interviews and and will be walking through what they look like, how to prepare for them, and how chipdev.io can help.
