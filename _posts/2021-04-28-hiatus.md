Dear members,

It is with great regret that the RPI-IEEE executive board anonunces the cancellation of elections for the upcoming summer and fall terms. Due to current issues there has been a decreased level of engagement over all academic organizations at RPI. As this is likely to be exacerbated over the summer term due to the decreased student population, it has been decided to go on hiatus for the summer term. Eletions will pick up early in the fall as most of the students, hopefully, return to campus.

Thank you for your time and effort, we hope to see you again soon.

-- RPI-IEEE Executive Board
