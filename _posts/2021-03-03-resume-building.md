Hello, everyone. On March 3rd, IEEE held a GBM lead by James, our internal liasion, and Reagan, our external liasion. Our GBM was held during Professional Development Week, and we sought to assist students on building up their marketable skills to recruiters of summer internships. <!--excerpt--> We discussed several ways to build a resume. We discussed volunteering, club activties, personal projects, and personal learning. All of which provide opportunities to students who want to expand their marketable skillsets. During this GBM, we also annouced our new Vice President, Colin Kilburn, who will be taking over VP duties until our election at the end of the semester. He is an Electrical Engineering major in the class of 2022. Please welcome him if you have the chance!

If you are interested in learning more about ho to market yourself to recruiters on your resume, please feel free to ask us questions in the IEEE Discord. We hope to see you again at your next GBM.
