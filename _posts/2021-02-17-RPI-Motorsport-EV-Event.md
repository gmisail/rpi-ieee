Thank you to all the people who came to our RPI-IEEE and Rensselaer Motorsport EV Interest event! For those of you who missed the event, 
Rensselaer Motorsport is looking to convert from an internal combustion engine car to an all electric vehicle in the coming few years. The 
event went well and we hope to do more events in the future alongside Rensselaer Motorsport. If you are interested in learning more about their
 conversion from IC to EV reach out the current leadership of Rensselaer Motorsport. Contact information can be found on their website at:

 interested in RPI-IEEE holding more events like this in the future, please let us know!Â
