Thank you all for coming to our first event of the year! It was wonderful to see everyone after so much time separated and isolated, and I hope we were able to assuage your worries on your professional life. Just as the career fair will be a recurring event we hope to offer the opportunity to better prepare yourself annually as well. <!--excerpt--> But also please remeber that applying for jobs begins before and extends well after the career fair and we're all on hand to help out anytime.

For those who were otherwise occupied never be afraid to reach out for advice on any part of the job application process!
