Hey all! 
During the first week of March IEEE, RPI's ECSE department, and HKN will be holding the ECSE Profesisonal Development Week. As part of this event we will be holding mock interviews with alumni. <!--excerpt--> In order for these interviews to be as realistic as possible, and hence all the more fruitful, the alumni have requested you inform them on what jobs interest you. <a href="https://forms.gle/2GuLxkhFMzWH2b9QA">Please let them know what jobs you like and/or are currently applying for!</a>Â 

-- The IEEE Executive Committee
